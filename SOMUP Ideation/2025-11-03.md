For my project, I want to do something to do with music visualisers. Can you come up with a few problem spaces I could tie this into?

###### Copilot said:

Absolutely! Here are several **problem spaces** you could explore for your music visualiser project, each offering a unique angle and potential for creative and technical depth:

---

### 🎧 1. **Accessibility in Music Engagement**

**Problem**: Traditional music experiences are often inaccessible to people with hearing impairments.

**Opportunity**: Design a visualiser that translates music into rich, meaningful visuals to enhance musical experiences for d/Deaf or hard-of-hearing users.

**Possible Features**:

- Visual cues for rhythm, pitch, and dynamics.
- Customisable colour schemes for different frequencies or instruments.
- Haptic feedback integration (optional extension).

---

### 🧠 2. **Cognitive Load in Live Performance**

**Problem**: Musicians and performers often face high cognitive load managing multiple tools during live sets.

**Opportunity**: Create a visualiser that provides intuitive, real-time feedback via OSC, helping performers monitor musical parameters without needing to check multiple screens or interfaces.

**Possible Features**:

- Minimalist, glanceable visuals for tempo, key, or dynamics.
- Custom OSC mappings to suit different performance setups.
- Integration with MIDI or DAWs for real-time control.

---

### 🎮 3. **Gamification of Music Learning**

**Problem**: Learning music theory or production can be abstract and disengaging for beginners.

**Opportunity**: Build a visualiser that turns music interaction into a playful, game-like experience, helping users understand musical structure through visual feedback.

**Possible Features**:

- Visual “rewards” for hitting certain notes or rhythms.
- Real-time feedback on harmony, timing, or dynamics.
- Customisable modes for different learning goals.

---

### 🌍 4. **Remote Collaboration and Feedback**

**Problem**: Remote musicians and producers often lack real-time visual feedback when collaborating.

**Opportunity**: Develop a networked visualiser that receives OSC messages from remote collaborators and visualises their input in real time.

**Possible Features**:

- Visual differentiation between collaborators.
- Timeline or waveform overlays for asynchronous review.
- Integration with tools like SuperCollider, Max, or DAWs.

---

### 🧘 5. **Music and Mental Health**

**Problem**: Music is often used for emotional regulation, but visual feedback is rarely part of the experience.

**Opportunity**: Create a visualiser that enhances mindfulness or emotional reflection through ambient, generative visuals that respond to music.

**Possible Features**:

- Mood-based visual themes (calm, energising, melancholic).
- OSC control from ambient music generators or playlists.
- User-adjustable parameters for personalisation.

## 💡 Project Concept: **“SonicCanvas” – A Customisable Visual Music Experience**

### 🎯 Goal:

To create a **real-time, OSC-controlled visualiser** that translates musical elements into **rich, expressive visuals**, enabling d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users to experience music through sight and interaction.

---

## 🔧 Implementation Ideas:

### 1. **OSC Integration**

- Use **SuperCollider** or a DAW to send OSC messages with musical data:
    - **Amplitude** → brightness or size of visuals.
    - **Frequency bands** → colour mapping or shape types.
    - **Tempo or beat** → pulsing animations or motion speed.
    - **Instrument separation** → different visual layers or zones.

### 2. **Customisation Interface**

- Allow users to:
    - Choose **visual themes** (e.g., geometric, organic, particle-based).
    - Adjust **colour palettes** (e.g., high contrast for visual clarity).
    - Enable **mood presets** (e.g., calm, energetic, dramatic).
    - Save/load **visual profiles** for different music genres or preferences.

### 3. **Accessibility-Focused Design**

- Use **clear, high-contrast visuals** for visibility.
- Include **textual or symbolic overlays** (e.g., “bass drop”, “chorus”, “beat”).
- Optionally integrate **haptic feedback** (e.g., via phone vibration or wearable tech).
- Consider **motion sensitivity settings** to reduce visual overload.

### 4. **Modular Visual Engine**

- Build a **modular system** in Processing:
    - Each module responds to a specific OSC parameter.
    - Users can toggle modules on/off or rearrange them.
    - Example modules: waveform trails, frequency rings, beat-driven particles, harmonic grids.

### 5. **AI Collaboration Opportunities**

- Use AI to:
    - Generate new visual styles or shaders.
    - Suggest mappings between sound features and visual elements.
    - Optimise performance or debug OSC message handling.
    - Reflect on user feedback to improve accessibility features.

With this in mind, can you find me some examples of existing solutions for this problem space?

Here are **four existing projects and tools** that align closely with your idea of creating a **customisable music visualiser for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users**. These can serve as inspiration and references for your project:

---

### 🎧 1. [**ViTune** – Visualiser for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing](https://dlsucomet.github.io/files/2020deja_vitune_chilbw.pdf)

**What it is**: A visualiser tool developed to allow d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users to "see" music through layered, dynamic visuals.

**Key Features**:

- On-screen visual effects that respond to music.
- Designed with feedback from DHH participants.
- Focus on reducing boredom and enhancing emotional engagement through visual attributes.

**Why it’s relevant**: ViTune is a strong academic example of a visualiser tailored to accessibility, with user testing and design iterations based on DHH feedback.github

### 🌈 2. [**Audiolux** – Visual Sound System by CymaSpace](https://www.cymaspace.org/audiolux/)

**What it is**: An open-source LED lighting system that translates sound into light for DHH audiences.

**Key Features**:

- Uses Arduino and addressable LEDs.
- Real-time audio-to-light translation.
- Available for DIY builds or event rentals.

**Why it’s relevant**: Audiolux shows how sound can be made visible in a live setting, and its open-source nature means you could explore integrating OSC or Processing-based visuals with similar goals.cymaspace
