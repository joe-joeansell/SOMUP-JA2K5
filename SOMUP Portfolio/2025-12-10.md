I was working with my code to start having visuals appear on screen as controlled by the JSON file, but p5.js was throwing back this error:
`p5.js says: It looks like there was a problem loading your JSON file. Try checking if the file path (blob:https://preview.p5js.org/3c24bf9d-c599-47d5-92b8-6e52e350004e) is correct, hosting the file online, or running a local server. + More info: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server`
I went to Copilot, and amongst many suggestions, it included this instruction to include a specific error message:

You're getting that p5.js error because the JSON isn’t actually being loaded. A few things are going on here:

---

## 1) The JSON file isn’t reachable (most likely cause)

**Why it happens**

- Browsers block loading local files directly for security (CORS). In the p5 Web Editor, you must **upload** `sentiment.json` as an asset in the sketch. If you’re running locally, you must use a **local server** (not opening `index.html` via `file://`). Otherwise `loadJSON()` fails and p5 shows a blob URL like the one in your message.

**How to fix**

- **p5 Web Editor**: Click **Files → Upload file** and add `sentiment.json` (and the images and mp3). Then use `loadJSON('sentiment.json', dataLoaded, jsonError);`.
- **Local dev**: Run a local server (e.g., `npx http-server`, `python -m http.server`, or VS Code Live Server) and open the page via `http://localhost:...`. Place `sentiment.json` in the same directory as your sketch (or adjust the path accordingly, e.g., `assets/sentiment.json`).

You can also add an error callback to see what’s happening:
```
function preload() {

  play = loadImage('playicon.png');
  pause = loadImage('pauseicon.png');
  stop = loadImage('stopicon.png');
  back = loadImage('reverseicon.png');

  fastforward = loadImage('fastforicon.png');
  musloop = loadImage('loopicon.png');

  // Make sure p5.sound is included in your HTML or enabled in the Web Editor settings
  song1 = loadSound('Airship_Serenity.mp3',
    () => console.log('Sound loaded'),
    (err) => console.error('Sound load error', err)
  );

  loadJSON('sentiment.json', dataLoaded, jsonError);
}

function jsonError(err) {
  console.error('JSON load error:', err);
}
```

This error function revealed that I had included comments in my JSON file with the // Syntax, which could not be read and was causing errors.
