Introduction:
Welcome to "SoundSeer". This is a music visualiser designed to allow Deaf and Hard of Hearing users to experience the emotional content of music in a visual format. SoundSeer is not intended to replace the traditional ways of listening to music, but hopefully serves to augment the experience in a positive way.

Notes for use:

The project has been designed for use both in personal and social situations, enabled by it's portability and easy setup. Designed for use on laptop and desktop devices. All features work on mobile but it's not presently designed for a mobile screen. Speakers and high volume reccomended.

Declarations:

This project has been created through the partial use of Generative AI tools, primarily the chatbots Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic's Claude. 

These tools were used to generate some sections of code, and for debugging.

Code that has been AI generated entirely or partially and code that I wrote and later debugged or extended with AI tools has been noted in the comments of my code.

Sentiment JSON files were AI generated but extended by me later.

HOW TO USE:

In this version of the project, control is achieved through the buttons at the bottom of the screen.

The project starts in a 'neutral state', with no motion and no sound. This is indicated by the icon in the top left.

To begin playing, simply click the play button, which will begin the song and accompanying visuals.

Clicking the play button again will pause the playback. Alternatively you can press the pause button. The pause button will also begin playback if clicked twice.

When in playback, the 'cloud' in the middle of the screen will change colours. These colours, as seen in the 'key' above the controls, represent different emotions. Beneath, a bar will change in size and intensity as the song gets louder and quieter.

There are other buttons for various types of control. Going left to right:

Stop- Stops and restarts playback. Semi-broken in current version, pressing "fast forward" will resume visual playback.

Reverse- Reverses audio and visual playback by five seconds.
Fast Forwards- Forwards audio and visual playback by five seconds.

Loop- Playback will loop upon reaching the end of cycle. Also semi-broken, visual playback can be resumed with "fast forward".

Currently supports two songs, though currently they can only be swapped by manually swapping them out in preload().
