Analysis

Here’s the JSON file you requested, containing an array of machine-readable timestamps with associated emotions:

[Download the JSON file](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/a8358175-d104-4c91-a389-231d73606176)

Example of the generated data:

[

    {

        "timestamp": "2025-12-03T12:42:05.692174",

        "emotion": "anxious"

    },

    {

        "timestamp": "2025-12-03T12:47:05.692174",

        "emotion": "calm"

    },

    {

        "timestamp": "2025-12-03T12:52:05.692174",

        "emotion": "excited"

    }

]

Would you like me to:

- **Increase the number of entries** (e.g., 100 or more)?
- **Add additional fields** like intensity or context?
- **Use a specific time range** instead of starting from now?
