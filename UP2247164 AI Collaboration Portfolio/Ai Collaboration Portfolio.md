### Strategic AI Briefing Documentation (500–600 words) 
Document how you provided context to AI tools, including your initial project brief, technical constraints, and creative goals. Include:
a. Your initial project brief given to AI tools
b. Examples of how you provided SuperCollider/DSP context
c. Evidence of how you refined your prompting approach

### Example Prompts and AI Outputs (800–1000 words) 
Provide 4–5 detailed examples of AI interactions that were significant to your project development. For each example include:
a. The exact prompt you used (in code blocks)
b. The AI’s response/output (in code blocks)
c. Your reflective commentary on the quality and usefulness of the response
d. How you modified or used the AI’s suggestion
### Critical Filtering and Decision Making (400–500 words) 
Document specific instances where you rejected or significantly modified AI suggestions. Include:
a. At least 2 examples of AI outputs you rejected with your reasoning
b. Examples of code you modified or improved from AI suggestions
c. Your criteria for evaluating AI suggestions in audio programming contexts

One example of an AI output I rejected came when I was developing the visualiser system, and working on a way to have the visuals transition between states. I asked Copilot...
### Collaboration Strategy Reflection (300–400 words) 
Reflect critically on your overall AI collaboration approach:
a. How your AI collaboration strategy evolved during the project
b. What you learned about effective human–AI partnership in audio programming
c. How AI collaboration affected your learning and creative process
d. Professional implications for audio programming practice
Initially, I set out with the goal to carefully moderate LLM output on this project. As the project went on, however...
-started to feel like i was somewhat losing control to the LLM output
-began to use it any time i got seriously stuck

Annotation Integration

Your AI collaboration portfolio must also include a reflective annotation that addresses the following:

1. Original Aims: What were your original aims for your artefact? Who is it for and/or what is it designed to do? You may refer to a persona or a "Jobs To Be Done" (JTBD) framework. Heuristics can be useful in specifying the desired behaviour of your artefact.

2. Influences: What existing tools influenced your thinking and implementation (e.g. NIME tools, commercial software)? What did you learn from them, and how have they shaped your work?

3. Implementation Process: How did you approach the implementation phase? What decisions did you make? Were any viability tests required to select hardware/software? What problems did you encounter, and how did you overcome or work around them?

4. Evaluation: Evaluate your finished artefact against your original aims and/or heuristics. Which elements are you most proud of? What would you change if you had more time, and how?

5. References: Compile an APA-formatted reference list that includes well-chosen technical sources and details of the tools that influenced your work.
